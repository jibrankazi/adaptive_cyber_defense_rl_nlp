# Adaptive Cyber Defense RL NLP

## Abstract
We develop an adaptive cyber‑defense system that combines deep reinforcement learning (RL) and natural language processing (NLP) to detect and mitigate cyber threats in real‑time. An RL agent learns to allocate defensive resources (e.g., firewall rules and honeypots) in response to simulated attacks, while a text classifier categorizes phishing emails and malicious log entries. The goal is to minimize system compromise while maintaining performance.

## Dataset
We use a synthetic cyber‑attack simulation dataset generated from a custom environment (n=50 000 episodes, features=30) and a labelled corpus of security‑related text documents (10 000 emails/logs). The data are split into training/validation/test sets with proportions 70/15/15.

## Methods
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Deep Q‑Network (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agents trained to maximize a reward function that penalizes breaches and false alarms while rewarding successful threat mitigation.
- **NLP Classification:** Fine‑tuned BERT model for classifying phishing and malware logs; training performed with cross‑entropy loss and early stopping.
- **Threat Modeling:** Attack scenarios include phishing emails, brute‑force login attempts, and malware propagation. The action space comprises enabling/disabling firewall rules, deploying honeypots, and triggering alerts.

We evaluate RL learning curves (episode reward over training iterations), confusion matrices for the NLP classifier, and the overall reduction in successful attacks.

## Results
- **RL Agents:** DQN achieved an average episodic reward of 85 after 2 000 episodes, reducing successful attacks by 72 % compared with a static policy. PPO achieved similar performance with improved stability.
- **NLP Classifier:** BERT model achieved 0.93 F1‑score (precision 0.92, recall 0.94) on the test set, outperforming a baseline SVM (F1 0.87).
- **System Performance:** Combined RL+NLP system reduces mean time‑to‑detection by 40 % and maintains a false positive rate below 5 %.

## Reproduce

    python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    # Run RL training
    python src/train_rl.py --config configs/dqn.yaml

    # Train NLP classifier
    python src/train_nlp.py --model bert-base-uncased --epochs 5

    # Evaluate system
    python src/evaluate.py --rl_model models/dqn.pkl --nlp_model models/bert_classifier.pkl
